      <p>I am passionate about user centric design, everywhere from the inital conceptualization of a product to the creation of actual artifacts and processes to effectively communicate with engineering teams. My experience in development, product management, and SCRUM Mastering allows me to work very efficiently and effectively with other teams and departments. I am equally at home as a team member or a team lead.  I can work with developers to tailor UX deliverables to the stack and techniques they choose, and I can work with them to find the right balance of UX tightness and coding efficiency. I can take wireframes and comps and decompose them into JIRAs according to the best practices adopted by the client. My higher fidelity wireframes can double as comps. I work best when paired with Designers or Creative Directors. I take pride in my deliverables and I play very well with others. I have created products for many companies, including Amazon and Warner Brothers. My interfaces have been used at the Sundance Film Festival and at Wimbledon.</p>
      <p>The <a href='index.html'>portfolio section</a> contains a few recent highlights of my work, and the <a href='process.html'>process section</a> shows how I typically work. Feel free to <a href='contact.html'>contact me</a> to have a discussion about the needs of your organization and to explore a fit.</p>

      <p>At Kreator303 we are passionate about user centered design. Depending on the needs of your project that can range from cranking out UX artifacts for existing projects to new product research, strategy, and design. We will work with your team in the manner that best suits the project. We take pride in our deliverables and we play very well with others. We work best when paired with designers or Creative Directors. WE have experience leading UX and Engineering teams.</p>
      <p>Our backgrounds in UX, development, product management, business strategy, and SCRUM allow us to interact with different departments and roles very efficiently. We can work with developers to tailor UX deliverables to the stack and techniques they choose, and we can work with them to find the right balance of UX tightness and coding efficiency. We can take wireframes and comps and decompose them into JIRAs according to the best practices adopted by the client. Our higher fidelity wireframes can double as comps.</p>
      <p>The <a href='index.html'>portfolio section</a> contains a few recent highlights of our work. Feel free to <a href='contact.html'>contact us</a> to have a discussion about the needs of your organization and to explore a fit.</p>
